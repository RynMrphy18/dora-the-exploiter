# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

Inputted variables and imported like in the week 13 module

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

Used schema and seeded database through git bash

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

Used node packages to port through a localhost server

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

Made find routes to find each either as a whole or by id

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

Made create, update and destroy routes respectively to manipulate data in db
